        <p class="blogContent">We’re a few weeks into October now, and you know what
          that means…<a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/blog/20309338" target="_blank">an Overwatch Halloween Event!</a> The holiday themed event for Blizzard’s
          popular team shooter runs from October 11th to November 1st and features exclusive
          loot you won’t see again. While the event is running, themed loot boxes will be
          available offering you the chance to score some sweet Halloween swag for your
          favorite characters.<br><br>
          The standout item is currently the legendary Witch skin for everybody’s favorite
          German healer, Mercy. The Internet has collectively gone gaga for this admittedly
          awesome costume design. <br><br>
          As a thank you to fans, and as a way to whet your appetite and get you back in the
          game, Blizzard gave all players one Halloween loot box for free. Who doesn’t love
          free stuff? I know I do. I especially love the awesome legendary Junkestein skin I
          got for Junkrat in my free box. I’m still holding out hope to unlock some of the
          other Halloween themed skins.<br><br>
          It isn’t just skins that are getting the Halloween treatment, they’ve also released
          voice lines, tags, victory poses and even emotes. Newest Overwatch character, Ana,
          has an adorable and awesome new emote that has been known to
          <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2016/10/14/13291350/overwatch-ana-candy-video" target="_blank">
          stop enemies in their tracks.</a> <br><br> That’s all for now. Happy Halloween!

        <h1 class="blogTitle">My Very First Post</h1>
        <h4 class="blogDate">Date: 10/15/16</h4>
        <p class="blogContent">Hello there! Welcome to my personal website. This is where you
          can find me writing about the things that interest me and life in general. You might
          find a post or two about video games, or the latest book I’ve read, or something cool
          I’ve just learned. But for this post, I thought I would write a little bit about this
          site. <br><br>
          I created this site for a class assignment, but hopefully that’s just the beginning.
          As it happens, I was already designing a portfolio site to showcase my skills and
          experience when I got the assignment. I was planning to design and build a WordPress
          site from scratch. What a happy accident that I was able to complete this assignment
          and further my personal projects at the same time!<br><br>
          Due to the requirements of the assignment, I created this site using Bootstrap,
          HTML, and CSS. And while the code does make a pretty nice looking website (if
          I do say so myself) it won’t run on WordPress. Translating this code to play
          nicely with WordPress is the next big step, and it’s one I hope to complete soon.
          Luckily, a lot of the heavy lifting is already done. Keep an eye out!</p>
